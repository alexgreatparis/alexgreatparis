- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexgreatparis
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning. I have +20 years of active automatic trading with TS, MC, MT4, MT5. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning with MT5, and I'm starting with python. I have realised that I will need help... I am just discovering pandas.ta and so would like to use them!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on these subjects
